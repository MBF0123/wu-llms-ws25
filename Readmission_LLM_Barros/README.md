# Readmission-LLM
This project is a hybrid AI system that predicts 30-day hospital readmission risk for patients using machine learning (Logistic Regression + tuned Random Forest), and then generates a readable explanation using a local LLaMA model running with Ollama.

The goal is to combine the strengths of structured ML models (for risk estimation) and natural language reasoning (for interpretability) to create a clear, lightweight, clinical decision-support prototype that runs locally.
